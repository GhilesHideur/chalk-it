# Chalk'it

Welcome to Chalk'it. Chalk'it ambition is to allow technicians, scientists or engineers, not specialists in web technologies, to build their own web applications based on the Python code, JavaScript code or web-services they develop.

![live demo](./assets/home/live-demo.gif)

Currently, Chalk'it allows to export and share standalone HTML apps with Python and/or JavaScript code, thanks to Pyodide.

## Usage

### Install

```sh
pip install py-chalk-it
```

### Run

```sh
chalk-it
```

Chalk'it will be automatically launched in your web browser.
